# Agent-Based Pathogen

- **Jun Han** (Environment and simulation), 
- **Jiahao Xu** (Environment, immunity/death, mutation), 
- **Michael Quintieri** (Documentation, presentation prep, troubleshooting/bugfixing)

All relevant code to generate and run the simulation can be found in "project cmse202 2.ipynb". **To generate and run the simulation**, simply run all code cells in order, at least through the simulation code. To avoid unforseen issues **if manually changing the parameters**, it is best to restart the kernel and run all cells in order from the start, at least through the simulation code. 

If seeking **to run the simulation multiple times with the same parameters**, it is sufficient to simply re-run the cell that does the actual simulation. This will result in a differently randomized simulation each time.
